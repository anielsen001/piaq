#+TITLE: Raspbery Pi zero based air quality sensor.

Very much a work in progress. 

I wanted a flexible framework to monitor air quality, so I used a Raspberry Pi Zero-W mated to air quality breakouts from Adafruit. 

Currently logs data to csv file on the sd-card. 

Records carbon dioxide, PM2.5, VOCs
